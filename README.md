Project based on the tutorial by Julio Casal on how to create an Web API using .NET 5, VS Code and C#. 
The JWT implementation was made by me.
My next steps:
>Implement a MongoDB for persist user credentials
>Implement an interface for handling the database
>Create new tests to cover the authentication part also
>Any other ideas? Please feel free to reach out :)
 
Some mistakes:
>The naming scheme on the commits should have been better
>My own organization in folders on the Desktop also need some work
>Some parts of the code were direct at learning some skills, rather than maximizing the effectiveness of the code
 
 
I am aware that there are more improvements to be made and some ways to optimize the code, it's definitely something I am looking forward to reviewing in more depth in the future.
