# REST API Project
Catalog of items for games

Project based on the tutorial by Julio Casal on how to create an Web API using .NET 5, VS Code and C#.   
  The JWT implementation was made by me.  
My next steps:  
  Implement a MongoDB for persist user credentials  

  Implement an interface for handling the user database  

  Create new tests to cover the authentication part also  
  Any other ideas? Please feel free to reach out :)    
  
Some modifications  
 Implemented a new folder structure
 Refactoring of the DTOs

Some mistakes:  
  The naming scheme on the commits should have been better  
   Some parts of the code were direct at learning some skills, rather than maximizing the effectiveness of the code  
 
 
I am aware that there are more improvements to be made and some ways to optimize the code, it's definitely something I am looking forward to reviewing in more depth in the future.
